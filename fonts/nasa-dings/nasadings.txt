This is a dingbat font with over 50 glyphs of NASA related dings. Logos, astronauts, spacecraft, mission patches and more.

Several glyphs have a mirrored counterpart between the upper and lower cases (as well as the numerals/punctuation). Use of a character map program, such as Windows' Character Map, will be very helpful in exploring and using this font.
